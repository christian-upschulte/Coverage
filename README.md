# Coverage
Mtg Coverage Hub/ Team Site


Cranial Archive is a hub for coverage and will host a history of coverage from large events
This includes: SCG Opens, Grand Prix, Pro Tours, Eternal Weekend, etc. 

The site will have a database of these events, and will be searchable through deck, event, player, format.

Hopefully when the site is releasable, we can set up a patreon, and or gain sponsors through other means. 
I hope to have team jeresys for events, mats, and sleeves to not only act as a team, but to promote the site. 

I would like this to remain as the three of us. 
For Christian, it is a way to prepare for the new job and get acquainted with Angular
For Kyle, this is a fun and useful tool. 
For Wyatt, this will be a massive resume booster. 

I think we should be able to deliver a solid product and hopefully make something useful to the community. 

We have big brains, lets put them to use. 

Thx.
-Christian
